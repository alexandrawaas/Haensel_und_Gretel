## Description

This is a little Demo of my 3D adventure game "Hänsel und Gretel - Verloren im Zauberwald" (Hansel and Gretel - Lost in the enchanted forest). It was created in Unity and retells the well-known fairy tale of the siblings escaping the wicked witch and finding their way through the forest back to civilization.
<br>
<br>
The Demo is part of the second level, taking place right after the children escaped from the witch's cellar. The goal is to unlock the door that leads to the western part of the Level, where this Demo ends.

**Currently, this Demo only works on Apple Silicon Macs. I will release a Windows version as soon as I can.**

## Story

After their parents abandon Hansel and Gretel in the forest, they are captured by a wicked witch who lives in a house made of sweets. Locked in her cellar, the children finally manage to free themselves. Now they have to venture out of the house together and into the dangerous, enchanted forest to find their way back to the village they called home. This is more difficult than expected, as the forest is a maze in which they can only find their way by dropping breadcrumbs, solving riddles and overcoming obstacles. Both Hansel's and Gretel's skills are needed to escape the forest safely. They can also help some of the forest's animal inhabitants, who have been turned into strange candy creatures by the witch's curse and can only be freed from it with a healthy snack. Will the two children manage to save the forest and themselves?

## Playable Characters

Hansel and Gretel are only ten and twelve years old and relatively small. Thanks to his petite build, Hansel can squeeze through the smallest of loopholes. His older sister Gretel, on the other hand, is taller and has a slingshot with which she can shoot fruit at enchanted animals to break their curse. Both children can drop breadcrumbs to mark paths they have already taken. The player can switch freely between the two siblings anytime in the game as long as they are both present in the respective level. While one of the children is actively controlled by the player, the other sibling follows them via a simple AI.

## Gameplay

The player navigates the siblings through the labyrinth, first in the witch's cellar, then in underground passages and finally in the enchanted forest. In treasure chests and hiding places they can find breadcrumbs, for example, which can be used to mark the paths. Sometimes they also contain keys that unlock new paths, or delicious fruit that can free some forest dwellers from a curse or convince them to help the children. All in all, the paths in the maze have to be opened by solving numerous different puzzles and challenges in order to reach the next level. Some of these can only be overcome by one of the children, who must then unlock another path for their sibling. Secret paths and challenges can also be found that make surprising objects or tools available. At the end of each level, a particularly dangerous candy creature must be fought to carry on.
